Pod::LaTeX::Book version 0.0.1

This Module is used to compile a collection of POD pages into a PDF
book suitable for printing and on-screen viewing. Additional features
relative to the PoD::LaTeX module include extensive hyperlinking
within and outside the document, displayed code fragments, and
improved line-breaking. Specification and fine-grained control over
the result is provided via a simple and flexible configuration file.

The resulting LaTeX file must be processed with pdflatex. Also, it
requires the LaTeX packages 'hyperref', 'listings', and 'fancyvrb',
all of which are on CTAN and in most tex distributions.
